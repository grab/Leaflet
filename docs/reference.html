var map = L.map('map', {
	center: [51.505, -0.09],
	zoom: 13
});

Creation

Methods for Modifying Map State
Method 	Returns 	Description
setView( <LatLng> center, <Number> zoom?, <zoom/pan options> options? ) 	this 	Sets the view of the map (geographical center and zoom) with the given animation options.
setZoom( <Number> zoom, <zoom options> options? ) 	this 	Sets the zoom of the map.
zoomIn( <Number> delta?, <zoom options> options? ) 	this 	Increases the zoom of the map by delta (1 by default).
zoomOut( <Number> delta?, <zoom options> options? ) 	this 	Decreases the zoom of the map by delta (1 by default).
setZoomAround( <LatLng> latlng, <Number> zoom, <zoom options> options? ) 	this 	Zooms the map while keeping a specified point on the map stationary (e.g. used internally for scroll zoom and double-click zoom).
fitBounds( <LatLngBounds> bounds, <fitBounds options> options? ) 	this 	Sets a map view that contains the given geographical bounds with the maximum zoom level possible.
fitWorld( <fitBounds options> options? ) 	this 	Sets a map view that mostly contains the whole world with the maximum zoom level possible.
panTo( <LatLng> latlng, <pan options> options? ) 	this 	Pans the map to a given center. Makes an animated pan if new center is not more than one screen away from the current one.
panInsideBounds( <LatLngBounds> bounds, <pan options> options? ) 	this 	Pans the map to the closest view that would lie inside the given bounds (if it's not already), controlling the animation using the options specific, if any.
panBy( <Point> point, <pan options> options? ) 	this 	Pans the map by a given number of pixels (animated).
invalidateSize( <Boolean> animate ) 	this 	Checks if the map container size changed and updates the map if so — call it after you've changed the map size dynamically, also animating pan by default.
invalidateSize( <zoom/pan options> options ) 	this 	Checks if the map container size changed and updates the map if so — call it after you've changed the map size dynamically, also animating pan by default. If options.pan is false, panning will not occur. If options.debounceMoveend is true, it will delay moveend event so that it doesn't happen often even if the method is called many times in a row.
setMaxBounds( <LatLngBounds> bounds 	this 	Restricts the map view to the given bounds (see map maxBounds option).
locate( <Locate options> options? ) 	this 	Tries to locate the user using the Geolocation API, firing a locationfound event with location data on success or a locationerror event on failure, and optionally sets the map view to the user's location with respect to detection accuracy (or to the world view if geolocation failed). See Locate options for more details.
stopLocate() 	this 	Stops watching location previously initiated by map.locate({watch: true}) and aborts resetting the map view if map.locate was called with {setView: true}.
remove() 	this 	Destroys the map and clears all related event listeners.

TileLayer

Used to load and display tile layers on the map. Extends Layer.
Usage example

L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?{foo}', {foo: 'bar'}).addTo(map);

Creation
Factory 	Description
L.tileLayer( <String> urlTemplate, <TileLayer options> options? ) 	Instantiates a tile layer object given a URL template and optionally an options object.
URL template

A string of the following form:

'http://{s}.somedomain.com/blabla/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png'

{s} means one of the available subdomains (used sequentially to help with browser parallel requests per domain limitation; subdomain values are specified in options; a, b or c by default, can be omitted), {z} — zoom level, {x} and {y} — tile coordinates. {r} can be used to add @2x to the URL to load retina tiles.

You can use custom keys in the template, which will be evaluated from TileLayer options, like this:

L.tileLayer('http://{s}.somedomain.com/{foo}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {foo: 'bar'});

Options
Option 	Type 	Default 	Description
minZoom 	Number 	0 	Minimum zoom number.
maxZoom 	Number 	18 	Maximum zoom number.
maxNativeZoom 	Number 	null 	Maximum zoom number the tiles source has available. If it is specified, the tiles on all zoom levels higher than maxNativeZoom will be loaded from maxNativeZoom level and auto-scaled.
tileSize 	Number 	256 	Tile size (width and height in pixels, assuming tiles are square).
subdomains 	String or String[] 	'abc' 	Subdomains of the tile service. Can be passed in the form of one string (where each letter is a subdomain name) or an array of strings.
errorTileUrl 	String 	'' 	URL to the tile image to show in place of the tile that failed to load.
attribution 	String 	'' 	e.g. "© Mapbox" — the string used by the attribution control, describes the layer data.
tms 	Boolean 	false 	If true, inverses Y axis numbering for tiles (turn this on for TMS services).
continuousWorld 	Boolean 	false 	If set to true, the tile coordinates won't be wrapped by world width (-180 to 180 longitude) or clamped to lie within world height (-90 to 90). Use this if you use Leaflet for maps that don't reflect the real world (e.g. game, indoor or photo maps).
noWrap 	Boolean 	false 	If set to true, the tiles just won't load outside the world width (-180 to 180 longitude) instead of repeating.
zoomOffset 	Number 	0 	The zoom number used in tile URLs will be offset with this value.
zoomReverse 	Boolean 	false 	If set to true, the zoom number used in tile URLs will be reversed (maxZoom - zoom instead of zoom).
opacity 	Number 	1.0 	The opacity of the tile layer.
zIndex 	Number 	null 	The explicit zIndex of the tile layer. Not set by default.
updateInterval 	Number 	200 	Tiles will not update more then once every updateInterval.
unloadInvisibleTiles 	Boolean 	depends 	If true, all the tiles that are not visible after panning are removed (for better performance). true by default on mobile WebKit, otherwise false.
updateWhenIdle 	Boolean 	depends 	If false, new tiles are loaded during panning, otherwise only after it (for better performance). true by default on mobile WebKit, otherwise false.
detectRetina 	Boolean 	false 	If true and user is on a retina display, it will request four tiles of half the specified size and a bigger zoom level in place of one to utilize the high resolution.
reuseTiles 	Boolean 	false 	If true, all the tiles that are not visible after panning are placed in a reuse queue from which they will be fetched when new tiles become visible (as opposed to dynamically creating new ones). This will in theory keep memory usage low and eliminate the need for reserving new memory whenever a new tile is needed.
bounds 	LatLngBounds 	null 	When this option is set, the TileLayer only loads tiles that are in the given geographical bounds.
crossOrigin 	Boolean 	false 	If true, all tiles will have their crossOrigin attribute set to ''. This is needed if you want to access tile pixel data.

filter( <GeoJSON> featureData, <ILayer> layer ) 	Function that will be used to decide whether to show a feature or not.
coordsToLatLng( <Array> coords ) 	Function that will be used for converting GeoJSON coordinates to LatLng points (if not specified, coords will be assumed to be WGS84 — standard [longitude, latitude] values in degrees).

Additionally accepts all Path options for polylines and polygons.
Methods
Method 	Returns 	Description
addData( <GeoJSON> data ) 	this 	Adds a GeoJSON object to the layer.
setStyle( <Function> style ) 	this 	Changes styles of GeoJSON vector layers with the given style function.
resetStyle( <Path> layer ) 	this 	Resets the given vector layer's style to the original GeoJSON style, useful for resetting style after hover events.
Static methods
Method 	Returns 	Description

coordsToLatLng( <Array> coords, <Boolean> reverse? ) 	LatLng 	Creates a LatLng object from an array of 2 numbers (latitude, longitude) used in GeoJSON for points. If reverse is set to true, the numbers will be interpreted as (longitude, latitude).
coordsToLatLngs( <Array> coords, <Number> levelsDeep?, <Boolean> reverse? ) 	Array 	Creates a multidimensional array of LatLng objects from a GeoJSON coordinates array. levelsDeep specifies the nesting level (0 is for an array of points, 1 for an array of arrays of points, etc., 0 by default). If reverse is set to true, the numbers will be interpreted as (longitude, latitude).
GridLayer

Generic class for handling a tiled grid of HTML elements. This is the base class for all tile layers and replaces TileLayer.Canvas.

GridLayer can be extended to create a tiled grid of HTML Elements like <canvas>, <img> or <div>.GridLayer will handle creating and animating these DOM elements for you.
Synchronous usage example

To create a custom layer, extend GridLayer and impliment the createTile() method, which will be passed a Point object with the x, y, and z (zoom level) coordinates to draw your tile.

var CanvasLayer = L.GridLayer.extend({
	createTile: function(coords){
		// create a <canvas> element for drawing
		var tile = L.DomUtil.create('canvas', 'leaflet-tile');

		// setup tile width and height according to the options
		tile.width = tile.height = this.options.tileSize;

		// get a canvas context and draw something on it using coords.x, coords.y and coords.z
		var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

		// return the tile so it can be rendered on screen
		return tile;
	}
});

Asyncronous usage example

Tile creation can also be asyncronous, this is useful when using a third-party drawing library. Once the tile is finsihed drawing it can be passed to the done() callback.

var CanvasLayer = L.GridLayer.extend({
	createTile: function(coords, done){
		var error;

		// create a <canvas> element for drawing
		var tile = L.DomUtil.create('canvas', 'leaflet-tile');

		// setup tile width and height according to the options
		tile.width = tile.height = this.options.tileSize;

		// draw something and pass the tile to the done() callback
		done(error, tile);
	}
});

Events methods
<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/reference.html

=======

A set of methods shared between event-powered classes (like Map). Generally, events allow you to execute some function when something happens with an object (e.g. the user clicks on the map, causing the map 'click' event).
>>>>>>> origin/gh-pages:reference.html
Example

map.on('click', function(e) {
	alert(e.latlng);
});

Leaflet deals with event listeners by reference, so if you want to add a listener and then remove it, define it as a function:

function onClick(e) { ... }

map.on('click', onClick);
map.off('click', onClick);

Methods
Method 	Returns 	Description
addEventListener( <String> type, <Function> fn, <Object> context? ) 	this 	Adds a listener function (fn) to a particular event type of the object. You can optionally specify the context of the listener (object the this keyword will point to). You can also pass several space-separated types (e.g. 'click dblclick').
addOneTimeEventListener( <String> type, <Function> fn, <Object> context? ) 	this 	The same as above except the listener will only get fired once and then removed.
addEventListener( <Object> eventMap, <Object> context? ) 	this 	Adds a set of type/listener pairs, e.g. {click: onClick, mousemove: onMouseMove}
removeEventListener( <String> type, <Function> fn?, <Object> context? ) 	this 	Removes a previously added listener function. If no function is specified, it will remove all the listeners of that particular event from the object. Note that if you passed a custom context to addEventListener, you must pass the same context to removeEventListener in order to remove the listener.
removeEventListener( <Object> eventMap, <Object> context? ) 	this 	Removes a set of type/listener pairs.
removeEventListener() 	this 	Removes all listeners. An alias to clearAllEventListeners when you use it without arguments.
hasEventListeners( <String> type ) 	Boolean 	Returns true if a particular event type has some listeners attached to it.
fireEvent( <String> type, <Object> data? ) 	this 	Fires an event of the specified type. You can optionally provide an data object — the first argument of the listener function will contain its properties.
clearAllEventListeners() 	this 	Removes all listeners to all events on the object.
on( … ) 	this 	Alias to addEventListener.
once( … ) 	this 	Alias to addOneTimeEventListener.
off( … ) 	this 	Alias to removeEventListener.
fire( … ) 	this 	Alias to fireEvent.

requestAnimFrame( <Function> fn, <Object> context?, <Boolean> immediate?, <HTMLElement> element? ) 	Number 	Schedules fn to be executed when the browser repaints. When immediate is set, fn is called immediately if the browser doesn't have native support for requestAnimationFrame, otherwise it's delayed. Returns an id that can be used to cancel the request
cancelAnimFrame( <Number> id ) 	- 	Cancels a previous request to requestAnimFrame.
limitExecByInterval( <Function> fn, <Number> time, <Object> context? ) 	Function 	Returns a wrapper around the function fn that makes sure it's called not more often than a certain time interval time, but as fast as possible otherwise (for example, it is used for checking and requesting new tiles while dragging the map), optionally passing the scope (context) in which the function will be called.

getParamString( <Object> obj ) 	String 	Converts an object into a parameter URL string, e.g. {a: "foo", b: "bar"} translates to '?a=foo&b=bar'.
template( <String> str, <Object> data ) 	String 	Simple templating facility, accepts a template string of the form 'Hello {a}, {b}' and a data object like {a: 'foo', b: 'bar'}, returns evaluated string ('Hello foo, bar'). You can also specify functions instead of strings for data values — they will be evaluated passing data as an argument.

trim( <String> str ) 	String 	Trims the whitespace from both ends of the string and returns the result.
Properties
Property 	Type 	Description
emptyImageUrl 	String 	Data URI string containing a base64-encoded empty GIF image. Used as a hack to free memory from unused images on WebKit-powered mobile devices (by setting image src to this string).
Transformation

Represents an affine transformation: a set of coefficients a, b, c, d for transforming a point of a form (x, y) into (a*x + b, c*y + d) and doing the reverse. Used by Leaflet in its projections code.

var transformation = new L.Transformation(2, 5, -1, 10),
	p = L.point(1, 2),
	p2 = transformation.transform(p), //  L.point(7, 8)
	p3 = transformation.untransform(p2); //  L.point(1, 2)

Creation
Creation 	Description
new L.Transformation( <Number> a, <Number> b, <Number> c, <Number> d ) 	Creates a transformation object with the given coefficients.
Methods
Method 	Returns 	Description
transform( <Point> point, <Number> scale? ) 	Point 	Returns a transformed point, optionally multiplied by the given scale. Only accepts real L.Point instances, not arrays.

Class

L.Class powers the OOP facilities of Leaflet and is used to create almost all of the Leaflet classes documented here.

In addition to implementing a simple classical inheritance model, it introduces several special properties for convenient code organization — options, includes and statics.

var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
	initialize: function (greeter) {
		this.greeter = greeter;
		// class constructor
	},

<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/reference.html
	greet: function (name) {
		alert(this.greeter + ', ' + name)
	}
});
=======
		Returns true if the element class attribute contains name.


		addClass(
			<HTMLElement> el,
			<String> name )

>>>>>>> origin/gh-pages:reference.html

// create instance of MyClass, passing "Hello" to the constructor
var a = new MyClass("Hello");

// call greet method, alerting "Hello, World"
a.greet("World");

Class Factories

You may have noticed that Leaflet objects are created without using the new keyword. This is achieved by complementing each class with a lowercase factory method:
<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/reference.html

new L.Map('map'); // becomes:
L.map('map');

======= String or false Goes through the array of style names and returns the first name that is a valid style name for an element. If no such name is found, it returns false. Useful for vendor-prefixed styles like transform. getTranslateString( <Point> point ) >>>>>>> origin/gh-pages:reference.html

The factories are implemented very easily, and you can do this for your own classes:

L.map = function (id, options) {
	return new L.Map(id, options);
};

Inheritance

You use L.Class.extend to define new classes, but you can use the same method on any class to inherit from it:

var MyChildClass = MyClass.extend({
	// ... new properties and methods
});

This will create a class that inherits all methods and properties of the parent class (through a proper prototype chain), adding or overriding the ones you pass to extend. It will also properly react to instanceof:

var a = new MyChildClass();
a instanceof MyChildClass; // true
a instanceof MyClass; // true

You can call parent methods (including constructor) from corresponding child ones (as you do with super calls in other languages) by accessing parent class prototype and using JavaScript's call or apply:

var MyChildClass = MyClass.extend({
	initialize: function () {
		MyClass.prototype.initialize.call("Yo");
	},

	greet: function (name) {
		MyClass.prototype.greet.call(this, 'bro ' + name + '!');
	}
});

var a = new MyChildClass();
a.greet('Jason'); // alerts "Yo, bro Jason!"

Options

options is a special property that unlike other objects that you pass to extend will be merged with the parent one instead of overriding it completely, which makes managing configuration of objects and default values convenient:

var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
	options: {
		myOption1: 'foo',
		myOption2: 'bar'
	}
});

var MyChildClass = L.Class.extend({
	options: {
		myOption1: 'baz',
		myOption3: 5
	}
});

var a = new MyChildClass();
a.options.myOption1; // 'baz'
a.options.myOption2; // 'bar'
a.options.myOption3; // 5

There's also L.Util.setOptions, a method for conveniently merging options passed to constructor with the defauls defines in the class:

var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
	options: {
		foo: 'bar',
		bla: 5
	},

	initialize: function (options) {
		L.Util.setOptions(this, options);
		...
	}
});

var a = new MyClass({bla: 10});
a.options; // {foo: 'bar', bla: 10}

Includes

includes is a special class property that merges all specified objects into the class (such objects are called mixins).

 var MyMixin = {
	foo: function () { ... },
	bar: 5
};

var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
	includes: MyMixin
});

var a = new MyClass();
a.foo();

You can also do such includes in runtime with the include method:

MyClass.include(MyMixin);

Statics

statics is just a convenience property that injects specified object properties as the static properties of the class, useful for defining constants:

var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
	statics: {
		FOO: 'bar',
		BLA: 5
	}
});

MyClass.FOO; // 'bar'

Constructor Hooks

If you're a plugin developer, you often need to add additional initialization code to existing classes (e.g. editing hooks for L.Polyline). Leaflet comes with a way to do it easily using the addInitHook method:

MyClass.addInitHook(function () {
	// ... do something in constructor additionally
	// e.g. add event listeners, set custom properties etc.
});

You can also use the following shortcut when you just need to make one additional method call:
<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/reference.html

MyClass.addInitHook('methodName', arg1, arg2, …);

======= - Sets the position of an element to coordinates specified by point, using CSS translate or top/left positioning depending on the browser (used by Leaflet internally to position its layers). Forces top/left positioning if disable3D is true. getPosition( <HTMLElement> el ) >>>>>>> origin/gh-pages:reference.html
Evented

When creating a plugin you may want your code to have access to the event methods. By extending the Evented class you can create a class which inherits event-related methods like on, off and fire
<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/reference.html

MyEventedClass = L.Evented.extend({
	fire: function(){
		this.fire('custom', {
			// you can attach optional data to an event as an object
		});
	}
});
=======
Property 	Type 	Description
TRANSITION 	String 	Vendor-prefixed transition style name (e.g. 'webkitTransition' for WebKit).
TRANSFORM 	String 	Vendor-prefixed transform style name.

>>>>>>> origin/gh-pages:reference.html

var myEvents = new MyEventedClass();

myEvents.on('custom', function(e){
	// e.type will  be 'custom'
	// anything else you passed in the
});

myEvents.fire();

You can still use the old-style `L.Mixin.Events` for backward compatibility.

// this class will include all event methods
MyEventedClass = L.Class.extend({
	includes: L.Mixin.Events
});

Layer

The base class for all Leaflet layers that implements basic shared methods and functionality. Can be extended to create custom layers by extending L.Layer and implementing the onAdd and onRemove methods.
Implementing Custom Layers

Custom layers should extend the L.Layer base class. L.Layer provides convenience methods for your layer like addTo(map), removeFrom(map) and getPane().

The most important things know about when implementing custom layers are Map viewreset event and latLngToLayerPoint method. viewreset is fired when the map needs to reposition its layers (e.g. on zoom), and latLngToLayerPoint is used to get coordinates for the layer's new position.
<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/reference.html

Another event often used in layer implementations is moveend which fires after any movement of the map (panning, zooming, etc.).
======= this Runs an animation of a given element to a new position, optionally setting duration in seconds (0.25 by default) and easing linearity factor (3rd argument of the cubic bezier curve, 0.5 by default). >>>>>>> origin/gh-pages:reference.html

Another thing to note is that you'll usually need to add leaflet-zoom-hide class to the DOM elements you create for the layer so that it hides during zoom animation. Implementing zoom animation for custom layers is a complex topic and will be documented separately in future, but meanwhile you can take a look at how it's done for Leaflet layers (e.g. ImageOverlay) in the source.
Methods

Every layer should extend from L.Layer and implement the following methods:
Method 	Returns 	Description
onAdd(<Map> map) 	this 	Should contain code that creates DOM elements for the overlay, adds them to map panes where they should belong and puts listeners on relevant map events. Called on map.addLayer(layer).
onRemove(<Map> map) 	this 	Should contain all clean up code that removes the overlay's elements from the DOM and removes listeners previously added in onAdd. Called on map.removeLayer(layer).
getEvents() 	Object 	This optional method should return an object like { viewreset: this._reset }for addEventListener. These events will be automatically added and removed from the map with your layer.
Custom Layer Example

Here's how a custom layer implementation usually looks:

var MyCustomLayer = L.Layer.extend({

<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/reference.html
	initialize: function (latlng) {
		// save position of the layer or any options from the constructor
		this._latlng = latlng;
	},
=======

A class for making DOM elements draggable (including touch support). Used internally for map and marker dragging. Only works for elements that were positioned with DomUtil#setPosition.

>>>>>>> origin/gh-pages:reference.html

	// these events will be added and removed from the map with the layer
	getEvents: function(){
		return {
			viewreset: this._reset
		}
	},

	onAdd: function (map) {
		// create a DOM element and put it into one of the map panes, by default the overlayPane
		this._el = L.DomUtil.create('div', 'my-custom-layer leaflet-zoom-hide');
		this.getPane().appendChild(this._el);

		// add a viewreset event listener for updating layer's position, do the latter
		this._reset();
	},

	onRemove: function (map) {
		// remove layer's DOM elements and listeners
		this.getPane().removeChild(this._el);
	},

	_reset: function () {
		// update layer's position
		var pos = this._map.latLngToLayerPoint(this._latlng);
		L.DomUtil.setPosition(this._el, pos);
	}
});

var myLayer = new MyCustomLayer(latlng).addTo(map);

Inherited Options

Classes extending from L.Layer will also inherit the following options:
Option 	Type 	Default value 	Description
pane 	String 	'overlayPane' 	By default the layer will be added to the maps overlay pane. Overriding this option will cause the layer to be placed on another pane by default.
Inherited Events

Classes extending from L.Layer will also fire the following events:
Event 	Data 	Description
add 	Event 	Fired after the layer is added to a map.
remove 	Event 	Fired after the layer is removed from a map.
Inherited Methods

Classes extending from L.Layer will also inherit the following methods:
Method 	Returns 	Description
addTo(<Map> map) 	this 	Adds the layer to the given map.
removeFrom(<Map> map) 	this 	Removes the layer to the given map.
remove() 	this 	Removes the layer from the map it is currently active on.
getPane(<String> name?) 	HTMLElement 	Returns the HTMLElement representing the named pane on the map. Or if name is omitted the pane for this layer.
Control

Controls represents a UI element in one of the corners of the map. Implemented by zoom, attribution, scale and layers controls. Can be used to create custom controls by extending L.Control and implementing the onAdd and onRemove methods.
Methods

Every control in Leaflet should extend from Control class and additionally have the following methods:
<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/reference.html ======= >>>>>>> origin/gh-pages:reference.html
Method 	Returns 	Description
onAdd( <Map> map ) 	HTMLElement 	Should contain code that creates all the neccessary DOM elements for the control, adds listeners on relevant map events, and returns the element containing the control. Called on map.addControl(control) or control.addTo(map).
onRemove( <Map> map ) 	- 	Optional, should contain all clean up code (e.g. removes control's event listeners). Called on map.removeControl(control) or control.removeFrom(map). The control's DOM container is removed automatically.	START 	String 	Name of the DOM event that initiates dragging. 'mousedown' for desktop browsers, 'touchstart' for mobile devices.
MOVE 	String 	Name of the DOM event for drag moving. 'mousemove' for desktop browsers, 'touchmove' for mobile devices.
END 	String 	Name of the DOM event that ends dragging. 'mouseup' for desktop browsers, 'touchend' for mobile devices.
Custom Control Example

var MyControl = L.Control.extend({
	options: {
		position: 'topright'
	},

	onAdd: function (map) {
		// create the control container with a particular class name
		var container = L.DomUtil.create('div', 'my-custom-control');

		// ... initialize other DOM elements, add listeners, etc.

		return container;
	}
});

map.addControl(new MyControl());

If specify your own constructor for the control, you'll also probably want to process options properly:

var MyControl = L.Control.extend({
	initialize: function (foo, options) {
		// ...
		L.Util.setOptions(this, options);
	},
	// ...
});

This will allow you to pass options like position when creating the control instances:

map.addControl(new MyControl('bar', {position: 'bottomleft'}));

Options

Classes extending from L.Control will also inherit the following options:
Option 	Type 	Default 	Description
position 	String 	'topright' 	The initial position of the control (one of the map corners). See control positions.
Inherited Methods

Classes extending from L.Control will also inherit the following methods:
Method 	Returns 	Description
setPosition( <String> position ) 	this 	Sets the position of the control. See control positions.
getPosition() 	String 	Returns the current position of the control.
addTo( <Map> map ) 	this 	Adds the control to the map.
removeFrom( <Map> map ) 	this 	Removes the control from the map.
getContainer() 	HTMLElement 	Returns the HTML container of the control.
Control Positions

Control positions (map corner to put a control to) are set using strings. Margins between controls and the map border are set with CSS, so that you can easily override them.
Position 	Description
'topleft' 	Top left of the map.
'topright' 	Top right of the map.
'bottomleft' 	Bottom left of the map.
'bottomright' 	Bottom right of the map.
Handler

Implemented by map interaction handlers.
Method 	Returns 	Description
enable() 	- 	Enables the handler.
disable() 	- 	Disables the handler.
enabled() 	Boolean 	Returns true if the handler is enabled.
Projection

An object with methods for projecting geographical coordinates of the world onto a flat surface (and back). See Map projection.
Methods
Method 	Returns 	Description
project( <LatLng> latlng ) 	Point 	Projects geographical coordinates into a 2D point.
unproject( <Point> point ) 	LatLng 	The inverse of project. Projects a 2D point into geographical location.
Defined Projections

Leaflet comes with a set of already defined projections out of the box:
Projection 	Description
L.Projection.SphericalMercator 	Spherical Mercator projection — the most common projection for online maps, used by almost all free and commercial tile providers. Assumes that Earth is a sphere. Used by the EPSG:3857 CRS.
L.Projection.Mercator 	Elliptical Mercator projection — more complex than Spherical Mercator. Takes into account that Earth is a geoid, not a perfect sphere. Used by the EPSG:3395 CRS.
L.Projection.LonLat 	Equirectangular, or Plate Carree projection — the most simple projection, mostly used by GIS enthusiasts. Directly maps x as longitude, and y as latitude. Also suitable for flat worlds, e.g. game maps. Used by the EPSG:3395 and Simple CRS.
CRS

Defines coordinate reference systems for projecting geographical points into pixel (screen) coordinates and back (and to coordinates in other units for WMS services). See Spatial reference system.
Methods
Method 	Returns 	Description
latLngToPoint( <LatLng> latlng, <Number> zoom ) 	Point 	Projects geographical coordinates on a given zoom into pixel coordinates.
pointToLatLng( <Point> point, <Number> zoom ) 	LatLng 	The inverse of latLngToPoint. Projects pixel coordinates on a given zoom into geographical coordinates.
project( <LatLng> latlng ) 	Point 	Projects geographical coordinates into coordinates in units accepted for this CRS (e.g. meters for EPSG:3857, for passing it to WMS services).
scale( <Number> zoom ) 	Number 	Returns the scale used when transforming projected coordinates into pixel coordinates for a particular zoom. For example, it returns 256 * 2^zoom for Mercator-based CRS.
getSize( <Number> zoom ) 	Point 	Returns the size of the world in pixels for a particular zoom.
Properties
Property 	Type 	Description
projection 	IProjection 	Projection that this CRS uses.
transformation 	Transformation 	Transformation that this CRS uses to turn projected coordinates into screen coordinates for a particular tile service.
code 	String 	Standard code name of the CRS passed into WMS services (e.g. 'EPSG:3857').
Defined CRS

Leaflet comes with a set of already defined CRS to use out of the box:
Projection 	Description
L.CRS.EPSG3857 	The most common CRS for online maps, used by almost all free and commercial tile providers. Uses Spherical Mercator projection. Set in by default in Map's crs option.
L.CRS.EPSG4326 	A common CRS among GIS enthusiasts. Uses simple Equirectangular projection.
L.CRS.EPSG3395 	Rarely used by some commercial tile providers. Uses Elliptical Mercator projection.
L.CRS.Simple 	A simple CRS that maps longitude and latitude into x and y directly. May be used for maps of flat surfaces (e.g. game maps). Note that the y axis should still be inverted (going from bottom to top).

If you want to use some obscure CRS not listed here, take a look at the Proj4Leaflet plugin.
Event objects

Event object is an object that you recieve as an argument in a listener function when some event is fired, containing useful information about that event. For example:

map.on('click', function(e) {
	alert(e.latlng); // e is an event object (MouseEvent in this case)
});

Event

The base event object. All other event objects contain these properties too.

originalEvent 	DOMMouseEvent 	The original DOM mouse event fired by the browser.
LocationEvent
property 	type 	description
latlng 	LatLng 	Detected geographical location of the user.
bounds 	LatLngBounds 	Geographical bounds of the area user is located in (with respect to the accuracy of location).

altitude 	Number 	Height of the position above the WGS84 ellipsoid in meters.
altitudeAccuracy 	Number 	Accuracy of altitude in meters.
heading 	Number 	The direction of travel in degrees counting clockwise from true North.

Global Switches

Global switches are created for rare cases and generally make Leaflet to not detect a particular browser feature even if it's there. You need to set the switch as a global variable to true before including Leaflet on the page, like this:

<script>L_PREFER_CANVAS = true;</script>
<script src="leaflet.js"></script>

Switch 	Description
L_PREFER_CANVAS 	Forces Leaflet to use the Canvas back-end (if available) for vector layers instead of SVG. This can increase performance considerably in some cases (e.g. many thousands of circle markers on the map).
L_NO_TOUCH 	Forces Leaflet to not use touch events even if it detects them.
L_DISABLE_3D 	Forces Leaflet to not use hardware-accelerated CSS 3D transforms for positioning (which may cause glitches in some rare environments) even if they're supported.
noConflict

This method restores the L global variable to the original value it had before Leaflet inclusion, and returns the real Leaflet namespace so you can put it elsewhere, like this:

// L points to some other library
...
// you include Leaflet, it replaces the L variable to Leaflet namespace

var Leaflet = L.noConflict();
// now L points to that other library again, and you can use Leaflet.Map etc.

version

A constant that represents the Leaflet version in use.

L.version // contains "0.5" (or whatever version is currently in use)
